## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how hard it is to create even a simple layout without planning ahead! I jumped into the challenge without really thinking about how I'd tackle it and I paid for it dearly. It took me a lot longer to finish the challenge and I had to modify the styles over and over again. I won't be making this mistake again!
